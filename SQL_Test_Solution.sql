# question 7: What are Entities and Relationships?
# Entities are objects that are contained in Master Data Services models. Each entity contains members, which are the rows of master data that you manage.
# Relationships are the established associations between two or more tables.

# A primary key is the field (or fields) that is used to uniquely identify each record in a table.
